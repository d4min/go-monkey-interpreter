# go-monkey-interpreter
Documents my progress, code implementations, notes, and learnings as I build the Monkey programming language interpreter from scratch.

## 📚 About The Project

This project follows the implementation of the Monkey programming language interpreter as described in ["Writing An Interpreter In Go"](https://interpreterbook.com/). 

Monkey is a programming language that features:

- C-like syntax
- Variable bindings
- Integers and booleans
- Arithmetic expressions
- Built-in functions
- First-class and higher-order functions
- Closures
- A string data structure
- An array data structure
- A hash data structure
